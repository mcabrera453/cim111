                   <p>Breathe. Create. Listen. These words have become an integral part of my journey as an artist, filmmaker, and human being. I began my studies as an actress in an experimental devised theater program in New York. In a fast moving city, it’s difficult to find time to breathe and reflect. During the time I spent memorizing the words of others, I began to imagine a world in which I had control over the messages I was presenting to an audience. My passion for storytelling had transformed. I dreamt I could change the world with my ideas, with stories, with art. I became inspired by my experiences in times of pain and adversity as a way to create a genuine connection with others. I moved back to Miami in search of my next creative endeavor. I spent six months in an Artist Residency Program in Wynwood where I began to explore creating my own work. Now, as a student at the University of Miami, I hope to achieve my goal to bring my imagination to the big screen and to challenge myself to create art that starts a conversation. As a human being, my experiences have given me the tools I need in order to pursue my passion: breathe to reflect, create to feel, and to listen to learn.
